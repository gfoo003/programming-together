## 1. Install/Setup

Python 3.9 (check "add python to environment variables")
Visual studio code
    Opening terminal
    Selecting color theme
    Installing extensions
    Selecting linter (an extension that analyses ur python file for python syntax and keywords and decides how to color code them)
    Running python

## 2. Computer architecture

(Cpu, memory, storage)

## 3. Python syntax

- Reserved keywords (if, else, while, return, print, ...)
- Constants (string, numbers)
- Operators (a*b, a /b)

- Assigning variables.
name = "winston"
print(name)

- Choosing meaningful names
a = "winston" vs name = "winston"

- String interpolation in python
print(f"my name is {name})
prints "my name is winston"
