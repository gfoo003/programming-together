## Python Lists
List: a kind of collection â€“ put many values [ ] </br>
- don't have to be the same type to be in a list
- lists are mutable but strings are not mutable
  ```python
    fruit='banana'
    fruit[0] = 'B' #not mutable
    #error only occurs when you try to insert an item not extract an item from a string

    fruit=['banana', 'apple', 'pear']
    fruit[0] = 'durian' #mutable
    print (fruit)
- list and strings are both iteratable

Range: returns a list of numbers that range from zero to one less than the parameter
*similar to 'up to but not including'*
